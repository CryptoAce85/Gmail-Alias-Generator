Features

Generate Aliases: Enter a Gmail username to create all possible dot variations (e.g., abc generates abc@gmail.com, a.bc@gmail.com, etc.).
Save as TXT: Download all generated aliases as a .txt file for easy storage or sharing.
Copy to Clipboard: Copy all aliases to your clipboard with one click for quick pasting.
Responsive Design: Modern, clean UI with Tailwind CSS, Inter font, and a gradient background.
Fast & Client-Side: Generates aliases in the browser, ensuring privacy and speed.
Loading Indicator: Shows progress for long usernames (e.g., 8,192 aliases for a 14-character username).

How It Works
Gmail ignores dots in the username part of an email address (e.g., john.doe@gmail.com and johndoe@gmail.com are the same). This app generates all possible dot combinations for a given username, allowing you to use unique aliases for different services while receiving emails in the same inbox.
For a username with n characters, the app generates 2^(n-1) aliases. For example:

abc (3 chars) ‚Üí 4 aliases
viralbeatsbyai (14 chars) ‚Üí 8,192 aliases

Usage

Open the app at cryptoace85.github.io/Gmail-Alias-Generator.
Enter your Gmail username (e.g., viralbeatsbyai) in the input field.
Click Generate Emails to create all dot variations.
View the aliases in the textarea, with a counter showing the total.
Use the Save as TXT button to download the aliases as a .txt file.
Use the Copy all button to copy the aliases to your clipboard for pasting elsewhere.
